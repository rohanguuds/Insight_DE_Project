## Intruder: a real time data pipeline to detect oil well interference

## Motivation:

   An oil well on average costs about ~ 8-10 million dollar to start producing. Sometimes the fractures of well drilled on the same pad, adjacent to each other might start interacting with each other. In this case, one of the well will suck the pressure of another well leading to depletion of pressure and eventually oil production of an well.
   Determining well interference at early stage will let you to take corrective action immediately, which in turn will save lot of money.
